Description: - We use various programming constructs like variables, echo statement, clear command and floating-point number arithmetic operations. To solve this problem statement first we declare variables to store values, echo statement to print output, clear command is used to clear 
Code
bs=20000
da=$(( bs*40/100 ))
hra=$(( bs*10/100 ))
ta=2000
ded=$(( bs*2/100 ))
pof=75000
pol=45000

netSal=$((bs + da + hra + ta))
netSal=$((netSal - ded))

total=$((netSal + pof + pol))

echo "Net Salary "$netSal
echo "Total Amount "$total
